# Customized AI API with Memory Feature

This backend API project integrates the Gemini AI API to provide chat functionality without requiring user authentication. It includes a memory feature to retain previous responses for ongoing sessions.

## Project Overview

The "Customized AI API with Memory Feature" project allows users to interact with the Gemini AI API via backend endpoints. Users can chat without signing up for one session. The API does not retain the history of user chats beyond the current session. Each time a user accesses the endpoint, a new session ID is assigned. If the user deletes the session ID, all chat history associated with that ID is cleared, allowing the user to start fresh.

## Features

- **Chat Without Signup:** Users can interact with the Gemini AI API without needing to create an account.
- **Memory Feature:** Retains previous responses for ongoing sessions.
- **Session Management:** Assigns a new session ID for each interaction; deleting the ID clears the chat history.

## Deployment

This project is currently under development and not yet deployed.
